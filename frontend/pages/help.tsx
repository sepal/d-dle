                            Guess what an A.I. tried to <b>doodle</b> in 5 tries!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal of the game is to try to guess what an A.I. tried to draw.
                            With each guess you get a new image, that represents the <b>same</b>
                            &nbsp;word. Each new image <i>should</i> be better then the
                            previous one and thus theoretically make it clearer what the word
                            to guess is.<br />
                            Unfortunately the A.I. is sometimes kind of a abstract artist and thus
                            a new image might not make clearer it ðŸ˜„.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With each guess the tiles will also change color as an additional hint,
                            which indicates which letters were correct.
                        </p>

                                    Yellow means the letter is present in the word to guess but at
                                    another position.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Gray means the letter is absent in the solution.

                            A game can be played once a day. Normally every day there should be a
                            new image to guess. Since the game is WIP that might currently not
                            happen.

                        <div>
                            The game tracks the following <b>anonymous</b> stats in order to improve it:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If was completed and if it was successful</li>
                                <li>Stats from the stats page</li>
                                <li>The entered guesses per game</li>
                            </ul>
                            No private or identifiable data is tracked.
