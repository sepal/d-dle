                            &nbsp;deep learning model.<br/>
                            Images are generated by the model on a regular basis, based on a curated
                            randomized list of words that is combined to a prompt. Each day one of 
                            the images is presented.
                            <br/>
                            The goal of the game is to try to guess what an A.I. tried to draw.
                            With each guess you get a new image, that represents the <b>same</b>
                            &nbsp;word. Each new image <i>should</i> be better then the
                            previous one and thus theoretically make it clearer what the word
                            to guess is.<br />
                            Unfortunately the A.I. is sometimes kind of a abstract artist and thus
                            a new image might not make clearer it ðŸ˜„.
