# dodle
dodle is a wordle like game where you have to guess what an A.I. tried to doodle.

A game consists of 5 doodles, each which *should* be better and thus be more recognizable what the word to guess is.
The doodles are drawn in advanced, together with the rest of the game. One game can only be played on the day it is released (unless there are no new games). 

To generate the model the [DALLÂ·E Mini](https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini) from [@borisdayma](https://github.com/borisdayma) and his colleagues. 
Thanks for open sourcing it! 

## Status

The game is now live and publish and can be accessed on [dodle.app](https://dodle.app).
Games are currently not generated automatically, since  I want to experiment with the model and what
images are generated. I also haven't found an easy and cheap way to run the model.
