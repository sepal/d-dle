# dodle
Wordle like game where you have to guess what an A.I. is drawing.

A game consists of 5 doodles, each which *should* be better and thus be more recogniceable what the word to guess is.
The doodles are drawed in advanced, together with the rest of the game. One game can only be played on the day it is released (unless there are no new games). 

## Status

The game is basically live, but just as a preview to do some user testing with friends and family. Thus currently no new games are generated.

Currently in the pipeline is:
* Refactor game generation
* Automate generating new games

Further improvements will be:
* Stats for games played (similar to all wordle games)
* Improve game experience
